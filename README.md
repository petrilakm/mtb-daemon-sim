MTB daemon simulator
==========

MTB daemon is a simple computer application.
It features 2 interfaces:

 * graphical windows
 * json tcp server

JSON server features API for setting MTBbus modules state, getting MTBbus modules
state as well as configuring modules, changing MTBbus speed etc.

[TCP protocol description](tcp-protocol/README.md)

## Program workflow

When program starts, configuration file `mtb-daemon.json` is read. If the file
does not exists, it is created. JSON server is started. When server cannot be
started, program dies. Main application loop is started.

Daemon searches for available MTB-USB modules. If it finds module specified
in configuration, it connects. It reports changes to clients and allows clients
to control MTBbus and MTBbus modules. When connection with MTB-USB fails,
daemon reports this event to clients and keeps running. When MTB-USB is
available again, connection is established again.

## Using

Just start the console application and let it run as a daemon on background.

```bash
$ ./mtb-daemon [config-filename]
```

The program takes a single optional argument – path to main configuration file
(default: `./mtb-daemon.json`).

See [Description of mtb-daemon.json file](doc.mtb-daemon.json.md).

## Building & toolkit

This library was developed in `vim` using `qmake` & `make`. It is suggested
to use `clang` as a compiler, because then you may use `clang-tools` (see below).

### Prerequisities

 * Qt 5/6
 * Qt's `serialport`
 * [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear)

### Example: toolchain setup on Debian 12 Bookworm

```bash
$ apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-serialport-dev
$ apt install bear
$ apt install clang clang-tools clang-tidy clang-format
```

### Build

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/mtb-daemon
```

And then build:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ qmake -spec linux-clang ..
$ # qmake CONFIG+=debug -spec linux-clang ..
$ bear make
```

## Compiling for Windows

Just open the project in *Qt Creator* and compile it. This approach is currently
used to build windows binaries in releases.

## Testing

This repository contains tests for MTB Daemon. See
[README in `test` directory](test).

## Style checking

```bash
$ clang-tidy -p build src/*.cpp
$ clang-format <all .cpp and .h files in the 'src' directory>
$ clang-include-fixer -p build src/*.cpp
```

For `clang-include-fixer` to work, it is necessary to [build `yaml` symbols
database](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-include-fixer.html#creating-a-symbol-index-from-a-compilation-database).
You can do it this way:

 1. Download `run-find-all-symbols.py` from
    [github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/clang-tools-extra/blob/master/include-fixer/find-all-symbols/tool/run-find-all-symbols.py).
 2. Execute it in `build` directory.
